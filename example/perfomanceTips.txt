1. DataSeries Optimizations
1.1 Data is Sorted in X (TimeSeries Data) is Faster than Unsorted (Scatter Data)
Impact: Large Improvement to Rendering in apps on all browsers

SciChart.js uses a number of optimised algorithms when your data is sorted in the X-direction.

Algorithms such as Hit-Test (used by cursors, tooltips), indexing and drawing have a faster path when the data is sorted in X vs. unsorted.

We recommend to ensure time-series data is sorted in X for the best performance, but SciChart.js will still draw charts with big data with unsorted (scatter) data just fine!

1.2 Specify Data Distribution & Properties
Impact: Moderate Improvement to Data Manipulations in apps with frequently updating data

SciChart will automatically detect the distribution of your data & properties to choose the right algorithms for fastest and most accurate drawing. For example, properties that SciChart detects include:

Data is Sorted in X direction
Data contains NaN (Not a Number)
Data spacing in X is evenly spaced
These properties allow us to choose the best & fastest algorithms for drawing, but detecting these properties takes some CPU time.

You can tell SciChart.js these properties in advance to save the time when creating dataseries, and appending and updating data.

Create Dataseries with Flags
const count = 1_000_000;
const xValues = Array.from(Array(count).keys());
const yValues = Array.from(Array(count).keys());

// Test 1: Create DataSeries with 1 Million points without flags
console.time("create series 1M points without Flags");
const series = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext, { xValues, yValues });
console.timeEnd("create series 1M points without Flags");

// Test 2: Create DataSeries with 1 Million points with flags
console.time("create series 1M points with Flags");
const series2 = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext, {
    xValues,
    yValues,
    dataIsSortedInX: true,
    dataEvenlySpacedInX: true,
    containsNaN: false
});
console.timeEnd("create series 1M points with Flags");
// Results
//
// Time to create 1 Million points without flags: 55ms
// Time to create 1 Million points with flags specified: 11ms
Specify Data Distribution properties XyDataSeries.containsNaN, dataIsSortedInX, dataEvenlySpacedInX when creating a DataSeries to save CPU time. Note you will need to update these flags if the data properties change.
       
1.3 Batch Updates to DataSeries
Impact: Large Improvement to Data Manipulations in apps with frequently updating data

SciChart DataSeries have functions like append(), insert(), update(), removeAt() where you can modify the data that the chart is showing. This allows you to achieve real-time updates in SciChart.

It is faster to update the DataSeries in batches aka using functions appendRange(), insertRange(), removeRange() where you modify an array of data than to use single-point changes.

DataSeries Batch Updates
// Test 1: Append 100k points one at a time
const series = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext, {
  dataIsSortedInX: true,
  containsNaN: false,
  dataEvenlySpacedInX: true
});
const count = 100_000;
console.time("dataseries.append(x,y) 100k points");
for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    series.append(i, i);
}
console.timeEnd("dataseries.append(x,y) 100k points");
// Test 2: Append 100k points using AppendRange
const series2 = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext, { 
  dataIsSortedInX: true,
  containsNaN: false,
  dataEvenlySpacedInX: true
});
const xValues: number[] = Array.from(Array(count).keys());
const yValues: number[] = Array.from(Array(count).keys());
console.time("dataseries.appendRange(xValues,yValues) 100k points");
series.appendRange(xValues, yValues);
console.timeEnd("dataseries.appendRange(xValues,yValues) 100k points");

// Results
//
// Append(x,y) 100,000 times: 69ms
// AppendRange(xValues, yValues) with 100,000 points: 1ms
appendRange(), insertRange() and removeRange() are much more performant than append(), insert() and removeAt(). This performance difference is more noticeable with insert & remove.
1.4. Initialize DataSeries with Capacity
Impact: Small Improvement to Data Manipulations in apps with frequently updating data

Internally, SciChart DataSeries use a geometric resizing algorithm which reserves more memory than needed as you call append(), appendRange(). Starting with a new DataSeries and calling .append() many times may result in several resizes of the underlying vector as the DataSeries grows.

To avoid this, and reduce unnecessary allocations, if the size is known ahead of time you can initialize a DataSeries with capacity.

DataSeries Pre-allocation
const COUNT = 10_000;
const CAPACITY = 1_000_000;
const xValues: number[] = Array.from(Array(COUNT).keys());
const yValues: number[] = Array.from(Array(COUNT).keys());
// TEST 1: Append 1M points in batches of 10k without capacity set
console.time("Append 1M points");
const xyDataSeries = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext);
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    xyDataSeries.appendRange(xValues, yValues);
}
console.timeEnd("Append 1M points");
xyDataSeries.delete();
// TEST 2: Append 1M points in batches of 10k with capacity set
console.time("Append 1M points with capacity");
const xyDataSeries2 = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext, { capacity: COUNT });
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    xyDataSeries2.appendRange(xValues, yValues);
}
console.timeEnd("Append 1M points with capacity");
xyDataSeries2.delete();

// Results
//
// AppendRange: 22ms
// AppendRange with Capacity: 15ms
1.5 Use FifoCapacity (if applicable)
Impact: Small Improvement to Data Manipulations in apps with frequently updating data

When you want to discard old data beyond a certain size, or scroll or sweep the chart, using XyDataSeries.fifoCapacity can improve performance (certainly reduces memory usage).

Fifo (First-in-first-out) mode pre-allocates a circulate buffer of size N internally. When a dataSeries is declared with fifoCapacity, then data beyond that count is automatically discarded. This limits the growth of memory and provides an efficient way to scroll or sweep charts, such as in signal monitoring or ECG (medical) applications.

Read the article on DataSeries Realtime Updates which showcases fifo sweeping and fifo scrolling.
1.6 Float64Array vs. Array
Impact: Small Improvement to Data Manipulations in apps with frequently updating data

Before appending data into XyDataSeries.appendRange() you must buffer the data in arrays of numbers. JavaScript and TypeScript offers a built-in typed array called Float64Array. Using this type as a buffer for your data conveys minor performance improvements.

Float64Array vs. Array
const COUNT = 10_000;
const xValues: number[] = Array.from(Array(COUNT).keys());
const yValues: number[] = Array.from(Array(COUNT).keys());
const xValuesFloat64 = new Float64Array(COUNT);
const yValuesFloat64 = new Float64Array(COUNT);
// TEST 1: Append 1M points in batches of 10k with number[] array
console.time("Append 1M points");
const xyDataSeries = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext);
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    xyDataSeries.appendRange(xValues, yValues);
}
console.timeEnd("Append 1M points");
xyDataSeries.delete();
// TEST 2: Append 1M points in batches of 10k with Float64Array
console.time("Append 1M points with F64");
const xyDataSeries2 = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext);
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    xyDataSeries2.appendRange(xValuesFloat64, yValuesFloat64);
}
console.timeEnd("Append 1M points with F64");
xyDataSeries2.delete();

// Results
//
// AppendRange with number[]: 24ms
// AppendRange with Float64Array: 21ms
1.7 Reduce allocations by re-using buffers
Impact: Small Improvement to Data Manipulations in apps with frequently updating data

If your code requires creating lots of Arrays to buffer data before passing to xyDataSeries.appendRange(), consider re-using these buffers to avoid continuously allocating new memory.

For example:

Tab Caption
const COUNT = 10_000;
// TEST 1: Append 1M points in batches of 10k with number[] array
console.time("Append 1M points");
const xyDataSeries = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext);
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // Allocate your arrays regularly
    const xValues = new Float64Array(COUNT);
    const yValues = new Float64Array(COUNT);
    // Todo: Fill your arrays
    xyDataSeries.appendRange(xValues, yValues);
}
console.timeEnd("Append 1M points");
xyDataSeries.delete();
// TEST 2: Append 1M points in batches of 10k with Float64Array
console.time("Append 1M points with re-used buffers");
// Allocate your arrays once
const xValues2 = new Float64Array(COUNT);
const yValues2 = new Float64Array(COUNT);
// Append your arrays to the series
const xyDataSeries2 = new XyDataSeries(webAssemblyContext);
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // Todo: Fill your array buffers before appending
    xyDataSeries2.appendRange(xValues2, yValues2);
}
console.timeEnd("Append 1M points with re-used buffers");
xyDataSeries2.delete();

// Results
//
// AppendRange with multiple array buffer allocations: 40ms
// AppendRange with single array buffer allocation: 24ms
2. Multi Chart Optimizations
There is a static overhead when creating multiple charts in SciChart.js. For one chart we run the drawing loop and WebGL drawing once, then copy the result to the screen. For 100 charts, we run the drawing loop 100x and copy the result to the screen 100x.

Below are some ways to improve performance signficantly when dealing with many charts on the screen.

2.1 Freeze Drawing for Charts out of view
Impact: Large Improvement to Rendering Performance in multi-chart applications where charts may be out of view in a scroll viewer or tab control

New to SciChart.js 3.5.727!

We've added a flag SciChartSurface.freezeWhenOutOfView which when set, uses the IntersectionObserver API to pause/resume rendering on charts which are outside the viewport e.g. outside of scroll view. This can yield large performacne gains when rendering many charts.

This can be used to achieve very large performance boosts by setting the flag, which can be set as a property on SciChartSurface, or via the constructor options e.g. SciChartSurface.create(divElementId, { freezeWhenOutOfView: true });

Read the blog post Creating a React Drag & Drop Chart Dashboard Performance Demo with 100 Charts which shows the impact of freezeWhenOutOfView where 100 charts are hosted inside a scroll view.
2.2. Grouping charts with SubCharts to share WebGL Drawing
Impact: Large Improvement to Rendering Performance in multi-chart applications where many chart panes are on screen, especially in some browsers (Mozilla, Safari)

The Sub-Charts API is a way to group charts into a single parent SciChartSurface. Using this API you can achieve the best of both worlds: having multiple chart panes and fewer drawing loop calls and fewer WebGL calls.

We've created a set of tutorials on how to create multi-pane and re-usable chart groups using the SubCharts API. You can find these below:

Re-usable Chart Groups with Sub-Charts
Dynamic Multi-Panel Charts with SubCharts
Resizable Multi-Pane Charts with SubCharts
Using SubCharts to create a Large Dashboard with 100 Charts
2.3 Reduce Axis Elements & Label Count
Impact: Moderate Improvement to Rendering Performance in multi-chart applications on all browsers

In a multi-chart scenario, axis elements and labels contribute a significant portion of the draw time. This is whether you use SubCharts or not.

Simply reducing axis elements (e.g. reducing the frequency of tick labels, gridlines), or turning off minor gridlines, major/minor ticks can signicantly improve the performance in cases where there are many charts (e.g 10 charts or more) on screen.

Read the blog post Creating a React Drag & Drop Chart Dashboard Performance Demo with 100 Charts which shows the impact of reducing axis elements where 100 charts are hosted inside a scroll view.
2.4 Use One WebGL Context per SciChartSurface
Impact: Moderate Improvement to Rendering Performance on some browsers e.g. Mozilla at the expense of slower chart startup time & higher memory use

The function SciChartSurface.create() uses a single shared WebGL Rendering engine and one shared WebGL context for all chart surfaces. This allows us to have multiple charts (up to hundreds of charts) in a single webpage. It results in lower memory usage and faster initialization (chart start-up time) in a multi-chart scenario.

The function SciChartSurface.createSingle() creates one WebGL Context per SciChartSurface. This gives faster drawing performance but will quickly hit the limit of WebGL contexts in a webpage. It also requires one instance of the WebGL Rendering engine per chart, so will have higher static startup time and memory usage.

Approximate WebGL Context Limits per browser can be found below.

Browser	Max WebGL Contexts per Page
Firefox (Windows, macOS)	300
Chrome (Windows, macOS)	
16

Edge (Windows)	16
Safari (macOS)	16
Safari (iOS)	16
Chrome (Android)	8
Individual WebGL contexts per SciChartSurface will give faster drawing performance at the expense of slower initialization time & larger memory than a shared WebGL context. This is more noticeable in FireFox or Safari than Chrome which performs very well for shared WebGL contexts.
3. Text Label Optimizations
3.1 Native Text Labels
Impact: Large Improvement to Rendering Performance in multi-chart applications which have a lot of text labels

By default, SciChart draws axis labels and chart titles using HTML5 labels. This allows more flexibility of choosing fonts but also introduces a performance hit. This is particularly noticeable when there are many charts on the screen (as many charts = many labels).

An alternative is to enable Native Text, where fast WebGL hardware accelerated labels are drawn. This will have a large performance benefit in multi-chart dashboards.

usenativetext
SciChartDefaults.useNativeText = true; // Globally enable native text for axis labels and chart titles

sciChartSurface.xAxes.add(new NumericAxis(wasmContext, { useNativeText: true })); // Per-axis label native text
Using native text gives significant performance benefits if you have multiple charts with lots of axis labels, or when you have multiple charts with chart titles. 

Read the blog post Creating a React Drag & Drop Chart Dashboard Performance Demo with 100 Charts which shows the impact of the Native Text API where 100 charts are hosted inside a scroll view.

3.2 Shared Label Cache
Impact: Moderate Improvement to Rendering Performance in multi-chart applications which have a lot of text labels

Previously labels were cached per axis, but it is now possible to reuse cached labels across axes and across charts. This improves label drawing performance in multi-chart scenarios.

You can enable this globally by setting:

useSharedCache
SciChartDefaults.useSharedCache = true; // Globally enable label caching

sciChartSurface.xAxes.add(new NumericAxis(wasmContext, { useSharedCache: true })); // Per-axis label caching
Or you can enable it for a particular axis by setting useSharedCache to true on the axis options, or directly on the SciChartDefaults type.

This will give significant benefit if you have multiple charts with very similar sets of labels, even if they are not on screen at the same time. Labels are retained in the cache for a minute, so switching to a different chart that has some or all of the same labels will reuse the labels, saving a few hundred ms.

Using shared label cache gives significant performance benefits if you have multiple charts with very similar sets of labels, even if they are not on screen at the same time.

Read the blog post Creating a React Drag & Drop Chart Dashboard Performance Demo with 100 Charts which shows the impact of the the label cache where 100 charts are hosted inside a scroll view.

useSharedCache is not enabled by default. If you are overriding getLabelTexture, it is important to ensure that the combination of text and label style is unique for each label texture. See the documentation for getLabelTexture for some ways to handle this.
3.3 Async Labels
Async labels was available in earlier versions of ScIChart.js, but has been deprecated in favour of Native text labels.

4. Miscellaneous Optimizations

4.1 Use the Fastest Browser!
Impact: Moderate Improvement to Rendering Performance

By far, the fastest browser for WebGL, WebAssembly and JavaScript is Google Chrome.

Browsers such as Safari, Firefox have slower execution of JavaScript code. Please bear this in mind when comparing performance or when making recommendations to your customers!

Use Google Chrome for the best performance with SciChart.js
4.2 Retina macOS Performance
Impact: Moderate Improvement to Rendering Performance on Retina Mac browsers

When SciChart.js is used on a high resolution display such as Retina, the chart will be rendered at 4x the number of pixels visible on screen. For example a 1,000 x 1,000 chart (1M Pixels) will be rendered at 2,000 x 2,000 (4M Pixels) before scaling down to the correct size.

Higher number of pixels means more work for the browser to display the chart. If you notice any performance degredation on your application you can disable Dpi scaling using the code below.

Disable DPI scaling
import { DpiHelper} from "scichart";

// Note: you will need to call this before any SciChartSurface is created
DpiHelper.IsDpiScaleEnabled = false;
Also, we recommend use of Google Chrome browser as this has by far the best performance metrics, compared to Safari or Firefox, which both struggle to render large canvases.

See Related Article on Retina DPI Support and Browser Zoom for further information. Use Google Chrome on macOS for best performance. You can also disable retina high precision in code.
4.3 Dual GPU machines or Macbook Pro
Impact: Moderate Improvement to Rendering Performance on Dual GPU machines

Some Windows PCs and many macOS computers such as Macbook Pro have dual GPUs. A slower integrated GPU which uses less battery power, and a faster dedicated GPU which has better rendering performance.

When using a browser (Safari or Chrome) on macOS, the operating system by default picks the slower, integrated GPU. Here's how you can check and force the dedicated GPU.

4.3.1 Checking which GPU you are using on macOS or Windows
In Chrome on macOS you can navigate to chrome://gpu in the address bar to inspect which GPU the browser is currently using.

Scroll down to GL_RENDERER. On the right you can see the current GPU e.g. 'AMD Radeon Pro 5500M' or 'Intel UHD 630'



4.3.2 Forcing the Faster GPU on macOS
If you are using the integrated GPU and want to force the faster GPU on macOS, you can use an application called gfxCardStatus to force switching to the faster and more powerful GPU. Restart your browser and do the test again. This will improve WebGL performance!

There are applications which will allow you to switch GPU on Windows as well. Make sure you restart your browser and do the GL_RENDERER test again.

Some computers such as Macbook Pro and certain Windows Laptops have dual-GPUs. Ensure the more powerful GPU is being utilised by your browser to get the best performance from SciChart.js.
