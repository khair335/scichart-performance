Dynamic Chart Layout in JavaScript with SciChart
Overview
This example demonstrates how to create a dynamic chart layout using SciChart.js with JavaScript. The primary purpose is to switch between a single chart view and a grid layout where each series is displayed as a sub-chart. The example includes a custom chart modifier that implements smooth animated transitions between layouts using the SciChart.js API.

Technical Implementation
The custom chart modifier (implemented in GridLayoutModifier.ts) watches a boolean property and, when toggled, calculates grid positions using relative coordinates. It uses the parent surface’s JSON definition (via the .toJSON() method) to configure sub-charts. The modifier leverages the GenericAnimation and the DoubleAnimator.interpolate method along with easing functions such as easing.outCubic to animate layout transitions smoothly. This approach allows each sub-chart to animate from a full-size position into its respective grid cell, and vice versa.

Developers can refer to the Custom Chart Modifier API for additional details on extending chart behavior. Moreover, the example shows how to convert the overall chart state into a JSON configuration and then reapply it to each sub-chart, following best practices for dynamic layout updates.

Features and Capabilities
Dynamic Layout Switching: The modifier enables users to flip between a single chart view and a grid layout where each series appears in its sub-chart. This grid layout uses relative coordinate modes and configurable padding to create visually distinct sub-charts. For more details on customizing sub-chart positioning, see the SubCharts Positioning documentation.

Smooth Animations: Utilizing GenericAnimation with interpolation via DoubleAnimator, the chart animates transitions between layouts. This provides a polished user experience during dynamic updates.

Data Series Sharing: The implementation shares dataSeries between the parent surface and sub-charts, ensuring that the underlying data remains synchronized while the series on the parent chart are hidden during grid mode. This approach is in line with best practices for managing dynamic series control in SciChart.js.

Integration and Best Practices
Even though SciChart.js supports multiple frameworks, this example focuses on the JavaScript implementation. The example avoids using builder APIs or hooks and instead relies entirely on standard JavaScript techniques combined with SciChart.js’s powerful API. For further insights on dynamic layout techniques and real-time chart updates, refer to Creating Re-usable Chart Groups with SubCharts the Performance Optimisation of JavaScript Applications & Charts guide.

Additionally, the interpolation techniques used for animating numerical values are essential for creating smooth visual transitions. Developers interested in understanding how interpolation works in this context can review the documentation for Animations API for more technical details.

This example serves as a solid reference for implementing dynamic grid layouts and animated transitions in real-time charts using SciChart.js with JavaScript.
